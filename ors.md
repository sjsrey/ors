# Introduction

The title of this talk could have multiple meanings. If one were to  use *Open* as
an adjective,  what would follow would be a discussion of the many ways
in which our world of regional science has embraced openness. An alternative
meaning would have *Open* as a verb in which case the talk that follows would be a
call to arms for regional scientists to engage with open science and open source. 
Still another set of alternatives would see different punctuations of the tile, with a question mark as in *Open Regional Science?* or an exclamation point *Open Regional Science!*. The former questioning whether regional science is truly open, the latter more of a challenge.

As should be clear in what follows, the thrust of my argument is that the verb and exclamation point interpretations are the correct ones. Indeed my purpose in this talk is to situate regional science within the paradigm of open science by arguing that our future should be linked to open data, open modeling, open software, open collaboration, open publication, open funding and open education. open science opportunities related to [1] technology-driven developments to address big data challenges, [2] crowd powered / citizen science; [3] educational developments

In order to do so I first outline what exactly constitutes open science and culture and the opportunities they may afford us. This is followed by an examination of a number of challenges standing before us that are responsibile for the gap between potential and reality. I close the talk with some thoughts about the likely future for open regional science.


Start by defining terms. Since I've already declared my choice of xx for
*Open* that leaves two more terms to define before getting to the body of my
talk. 

This talk extends some themes I have been developing in previous work
[@Rey:2009xy; @Rey2012osgres].

# Regional Science

Define science - its purpose, impact and future. 
Define regional science


The goal of this talk is t
Open science and culture arises from the open source software development
revolution.

Culture is broader than just open source software [@Sui:2013kx]
To engage regional science with open science I organize the talk around the
key dimensions of the open paradigm




## Opportunities: Open Science

General issues with the commercialization of science

lay out the problem

link the inspiration from open source


reproducibility

closed science depletion of a common resource


open funding and kick starter crowdfunding initiatives

### Open Source



### Open Data


Open Data Charter  [@Eaves:2013fk] is a recognition that in addition to
fostering innovation and transparency, open data can also drive public policy.

### Open Modeling
Since the early days of regional science Walter Isard envisioned that
integration would be a hallmark of our discipline. Channels of synthesis,
efforts at integration, integrated modeling [@Hewings:2004fk].

It is sobering to contrast that grand vision with today's state of our
modeling
science. To a very real extent, integration of different modeling efforts has
fallen far short of this vision. Rather than a rich ecosystem  of interconnected
modeling components the silo business model appears to have won the day.  In
part this reflects the economics of the regional modeling business were the
development, continued enhancement and support of modeling frameworks requires
stable and constant financial support.  Logically that support can be
attracted through marketing efforts.

At the same time, we as a community of regional modelers have paid scant
attention to model interoperability. A search of the leading proprietary
regional models (REMI, IMPLAN) failed to turn up any references to application programing
interfaces (API) which could be used to couple different modeling frameworks
together. The finger should not just be pointed at proprietary modeling
systems, as the academic community has also largely ignored interoperability concerns.

The lack of interoperability has hindered progress in the area of integrated
modeling as much of the research effort has focused on the challenges of
fusing existing modeling frameworks using different integration strategies [@Rey:2000df].
If model designers had paid more attention to interoperability, modularity and
basic object oriented practices [@Jackson:1994hl] less of the research effort
would have been spent on refactoring integration strategies and more on
enhancing  and applying integrated models to pressing regional economic issues.
This lack of interoperability is particularly worrisome given the
growing recognition of the importance of research on coupled natural-human
systems and the need for analytical frameworks to support inquiry.

UrbanSim as an exception


Interoperabiity and open modeling are vital to our ability to move regional
science into the high performance computing era.

### Open Collaboration

release early release often

workflow in a github repository

### Open Publishing

Scipy 2013 example http://stefanv.github.io/blog/2013/06/27/scipy2013-proceedings/

Highlight collaborative process from the blog post

Give overview of the process

### Open Education


Web book of regional science as an exemplar

## Challenges 

### Institutions

Academia second most conservative instution every invented, next to opera

Academic reward system

Ironically, it would appear that open source and academic science have been
largely separated at birth. Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel
and arguably one of the major figures in the open source movement, expressed
his disenchantment with the state of operating systems research in academia as
a motivation for leaving the university [@Moody:2001vg].



### Commercialization of Science


### Scientific Publishing

Concerns about scientific software [@Joppa17052013; @Yalta:2010xq].


austerity debacle


## Peer Review


## Data Hoarding

census research centers

recognize confidentiality concerns

problem of replication and network effects - with enough eyes all bugs are
shallow

Linus' Law: given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow



# Opportunities


## A Way Forward


## Open Community

notion of "open people"

importance of community

strength of regional science is its interdisciplanary outlook

## Conclusion

Way forward will represent a mixture of open and proprietary regional science. This hybrid model will, however, represent a rebalancing of many components of regional science as it engages with open science. Our choice is whether that engagement takes an active or passive form.

To close this talk I think regional scientists (actually all scientists) would do well by taking the Dalai Lama's recommendation to heart:

> Share your knowledge, it is a way to achieve immortality.
