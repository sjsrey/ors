## Introduction

The title of this talk could have multiple meanings. One would use *Open* as
an adjective in which case what follows would be discussion in the many ways
in which our world of regional science has embraced openness. An alternative
meaning would have *Open* as a verb in which case the talk that follows is a
call to arms.

Start by defining terms. Since I've already declared my choice of xx for
*Open* that leaves two more terms to define before getting to the body of my
talk.
