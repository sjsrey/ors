% Open Regional Science[^talk]
% Sergio J. Rey[^inst]



**DRAFT**

# Introduction

The title of this talk could have multiple meanings. One would use *Open* as
an adjective in which case what follows would be discussion in the many ways
in which our world of regional science has embraced openness. An alternative
meaning would have *Open* as a verb in which case the talk that follows is a
call to arms.

Start by defining terms. Since I've already declared my choice of xx for
*Open* that leaves two more terms to define before getting to the body of my
talk. 

This talk extends some themes I have been developing in previous work
[@Rey:2009xy; @Rey2012osgres].

# Regional Science

Define science - its purpose, impact and future. 
Define regional science

# Problems

Concerns about scientific software [@Joppa17052013; @Yalta:2010xq].


## Peer Review





# Opportunities


## A Way Forward

Ironically, it would appear that open source and academic science have been
largely separated at birth. Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel
and arguably one of the major figures in the open source movement, expressed
his disenchantment with the state of operating systems research in academia as
a motivation for leaving the university [@Moody:2001vg].

To close this talk I think regional scientists (actually all scientists) would do well by taking the Dalai Lama's recommendation to heart:

> Share your knowledge, it is a way to achieve immortality.
