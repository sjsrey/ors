**DRAFT**

# Introduction

The title of this talk could have multiple meanings. If one were to  use *Open* as
an adjective in  what would follow would be discussion in the many ways
in which our world of regional science has embraced openness. An alternative
meaning would have *Open* as a verb in which case the talk that follows is a
call to arms.

Start by defining terms. Since I've already declared my choice of xx for
*Open* that leaves two more terms to define before getting to the body of my
talk. 

This talk extends some themes I have been developing in previous work
[@Rey:2009xy; @Rey2012osgres].

# Regional Science

Define science - its purpose, impact and future. 
Define regional science

# Problems

Concerns about scientific software [@Joppa17052013; @Yalta:2010xq].


austerity debacle


## Peer Review


## Data Hoarding

census research centers

recognize confidentiality concerns

problem of replication and network effects - with enough eyes all bugs are
shallow

Linus' Law: given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow


## Modeling Silos

Since the early days of regional science Walter Isard envisioned that
integration would be a hallmark of our discipline. Channels of synthesis,
efforts at integration, integrated modeling [@Hewings:2004fk].

It is sobering to contrast that grand vision with today's state of our
modeling
science. To a very real extent, integration of different modeling efforts has
fallen far short of this vision. Rather than a rich ecosystem  of interconnected
modeling components the silo business model appears to have won the day.  In
part this reflects the economics of the regional modeling business were the
development, continued enhancement and support of modeling frameworks requires
stable and constant financial support.  Logically that support can be
attracted through marketing efforts.

At the same time, we as a community of regional modelers have paid scant
attention to model interoperability. A search of the leading proprietary
regional models (REMI, IMPLAN) failed to turn up any references to application programing
interfaces (API) which could be used to couple different modeling frameworks
together. The finger should not just be pointed at proprietary modeling
systems, as the academic community has also largely ignored interoperability concerns.

The lack of interoperability has hindered progress in the area of integrated
modeling as much of the research effort has focused on the challenges of
fusing existing modeling frameworks using different integration strategies [@Rey:2000df].
If model designers had paid more attention to interoperability, modularity and
basic object oriented practices [@Jackson:1994hl] less of the research effort
would have been spent on refactoring integration strategies and more on
enhancing  and applying integrated models to pressing regional economic issues.
This lack of interoperability is particularly worrisome given the
growing recognition of the importance of research on coupled natural-human
systems and the need for analytical frameworks to support inquiry.

# Opportunities


## A Way Forward

Ironically, it would appear that open source and academic science have been
largely separated at birth. Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel
and arguably one of the major figures in the open source movement, expressed
his disenchantment with the state of operating systems research in academia as
a motivation for leaving the university [@Moody:2001vg].

## Open Community

notion of "open people"

importance of community

strength of regional science is its interdisciplanary outlook

## Conclusion

To close this talk I think regional scientists (actually all scientists) would do well by taking the Dalai Lama's recommendation to heart:

> Share your knowledge, it is a way to achieve immortality.
