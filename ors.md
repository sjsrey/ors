# Introduction

The title of this talk could have multiple meanings. If one were to  use *Open* as
an adjective,  what would follow would be a discussion of the many ways
in which our world of regional science has embraced openness. An alternative
meaning would have *Open* as a verb in which case the talk that follows would be a
call to arms for regional scientists to engage with open science and open source. 
Still another set of alternatives would see different punctuations of the tile, with a question mark as in *Open Regional Science?* or an exclamation point *Open Regional Science!*. The former questioning whether regional science is truly open, the latter more of a challenge.

As should be clear in what follows, the thrust of my argument is that the verb and exclamation point interpretations are the correct ones. Indeed my purpose in this talk is to situate regional science within the paradigm of open science by arguing that our future should be linked to open data, open modeling, open software, open collaboration, open publication, open funding and open education. open science opportunities related to [1] technology-driven developments to address big data challenges, [2] crowd powered / citizen science; [3] educational developments

In order to do so I first outline what exactly constitutes open science and culture. This is followed by a more detailed examination of each of the components of open science and the extent to which they are operative in regional science with specific attention given to cases where there is a gap between potential and the opportunities they may afford us. I close the talk with some thoughts about the likely future for open regional science.


Start by defining terms. Since I've already declared my choice of xx for
*Open* that leaves two more terms to define before getting to the body of my
talk. 

Scientific publishing - issues - lead to reproducibility

This talk extends some themes I have been developing in previous work
[@Rey:2009xy; @Rey2012osgres].

## Science: Captured or Open

I, and I suspect many of you, take the *science* part of regional science seriously. We see science as one of the best constructions of human kind, running close to beer. We hold it in such high esteem as science as the noble goals helping us to:

- understand our world
- uncover new knowledge
- improve our realities for the betterment of human kind

Defining science can be done many ways, but a common approach is to break science down into components: theory, methods and data. 

Origins in Descarte's Discourse on Methods in the 1637. From the beginning the concept of reproducibility was at the core. As  [@Schroeder:2013uq] notes the motto of the Royal Socieity 1671

>Nullius in Verba
>"take nobody's word for it"

Publishing as the letters in the society as a way to hasten dissemination relative to book publication. 

Use of three referees as a model for the review process dates back to this period.

Evolution of scientific publication.

Complexity in doing science, computation burden and related technological developments are challenging the traditional scientific publishing model. No longer does a regular lengthed paper in a hardbound journal adequately capture the scientific process underlying a research effort.

Reproducibility is almost invariably not possible in the current model


Career pressures sustain the curent model. Publish or perish has been the mantra we have adopted, leaving little or no time for ensuring that what we publish could in fact be reproduced by future scholars.

It should not come as surprise that the state of reproduciblity is so dismal.

Define science - its purpose, impact and future. 
Define regional science


The goal of this talk is t
Open science and culture arises from the open source software development
revolution.

Culture is broader than just open source software [@Sui:2013kx]
To engage regional science with open science I organize the talk around the
key dimensions of the open paradigm



## Scientific Publishing - Where we are

Time to publish on the web
- Typically 1 hour
- small marginal costs
- supports data and software pblication

contrast this with commercial publish. Time to publish an article from the date of submission typically is 1-2 years. The form of journals means that software and data are generally not included as part of the publication. And, the costs of commercial publishing are high, both on the production side of things where estimates are and avverage of 500 Euros per paper, but also on the access side of the coin where costs to read the same paper average 30 Euros.

[@Schroeder:2013uq]

Subscription costs and Universities cancelling subscriptions. Elsevier boycott
UK open access mandate.

Curated or captured science is the result. Publishers own the copyright of the paper and have enclosed the theory within the confines of the article. Software and data are generally not to be found, even in cases where the paper access costs can be borne. 

Summary

Too much attention on documents as the only research artifact - data and software are not part of the discussion. Meta-analysis of research areas becomes prohibitively expensive - limits synthesis of knowledge. Science has been captured by commercial interests. All of this leads to major problems of irreproducibility. Essentially what is being compriised is:

>Science's capacity for self-correction comes from its openness to scruitiny and challenges

[@Boulton:2012kx]

If openennes is in question, science is in question.



## Opportunities: Open Science

A prominent theme in the recent literature on open science is reproducibility.

closed science depletion of a common resource


open funding and kick starter crowdfunding initiatives

For science to be truly open, two components need to be operative. *Open data* constitutes available, intelligible, asssessible and useable data.  *Open access*  to scientific publications and knowledge allows the realization of the building on shoulders of giants XXXget quote. Accessbility is more than the ability to acquire since a key impediment to scientific progress is that much published research is unintelligible beyond the origin specialist domain. This effective communication of results and methods is paramount [@Boulton:2012kx].

### Open Source



### Open Data


Open Data Charter  [@Eaves:2013fk] is a recognition that in addition to fostering innovation and transparency, open data can also drive public policy.

### Open Modeling
Since the early days of regional science Walter Isard envisioned that
integration would be a hallmark of our discipline. Channels of synthesis,
efforts at integration, integrated modeling [@Hewings:2004fk].

It is sobering to contrast that grand vision with today's state of our
modeling
science. To a very real extent, integration of different modeling efforts has
fallen far short of this vision. Rather than a rich ecosystem  of interconnected
modeling components the silo business model appears to have won the day.  In
part this reflects the economics of the regional modeling business were the
development, continued enhancement and support of modeling frameworks requires
stable and constant financial support.  Logically that support can be
attracted through marketing efforts.

At the same time, we as a community of regional modelers have paid scant
attention to model interoperability. A search of the leading proprietary
regional models (REMI, IMPLAN) failed to turn up any references to application programing
interfaces (API) which could be used to couple different modeling frameworks
together. The finger should not just be pointed at proprietary modeling
systems, as the academic community has also largely ignored interoperability concerns.

The lack of interoperability has hindered progress in the area of integrated
modeling as much of the research effort has focused on the challenges of
fusing existing modeling frameworks using different integration strategies [@Rey:2000df].
If model designers had paid more attention to interoperability, modularity and
basic object oriented practices [@Jackson:1994hl] less of the research effort
would have been spent on refactoring integration strategies and more on
enhancing  and applying integrated models to pressing regional economic issues.
This lack of interoperability is particularly worrisome given the
growing recognition of the importance of research on coupled natural-human
systems and the need for analytical frameworks to support inquiry.

### Open Collaboration

### Open Publishing

There are signs that alternative open models for scientific publishing are beginning to get traction. A recent example that I had exerience with was the publication of the conference proceedings for the 2013 Scientific Computing with Python (SciPy2013) conference. The entire process was produced using open source tools, including GitHub for file submission, reviewing and ultimately publishing. Authors were provided with templates to build their papers and these templates using *ReStructuredText* were made available via a *forking* of the proceedings GitHub repository. When their paper was ready for submission, the authors issued a *pull request*. Once the pull request was merged, the editors contacted referees via a web form and the reviews were then integrated into the GitHub repository. Authors were then asked to respond to the comments and submit a new pull request for the revised version. The final accepted versions of the papers were published in the proceedings [@scipy:2013vn] as an open-access publication distributed under the terms of the *Creative Commons Attribution License*.

Several aspects of this process are worth noting. The process relied on technologies that were already familiar to this community of scholars who use code repositories for collaboration on the development of scientific software on a regular basis.  In addition to the technologies,  the traditional roles of author, reviewer, and editor were mapped into those of participants in an open source software development model is innovative. In this model developers (authors) wishing to contribute a new software feature (article) to a field issue a pull request (submission) to the project (journal). That pull request (manuscript submission) is then reviewed by the community (editor and reviewers) and bug reports (referee reports) are submitted. The developer (author) then incorporates the feedback from the bug report (reviews) into the manuscript and updates the pull request (revision submission). At the end of the process the project maintainer (editor), has to make a final decision. The pull request would be merged in the case where the paper is accepted, or simply closed but not merged if the paper were rejected. In the former case the paper would appear in the final published proceedings. In contrast to the traditional publication model however, papers that were rejected in the process actually remain in the repository as the trail of pull requests, bug reports and publication decisions is available for all to see.

Perhaps more importantly, this design enhanced the collaborative nature of the enterprise as the reviewers took on roles of allies in helping to improve the papers. This stood in stark contrast to the traditional review process in which papers can be shredded by reviewers. At the same time, the open source model was highly efficient as the review process started with an initial pull request deadline of May 19th and final publication of the proceedings just over two months later. The organization of the review process akin to  an open source software development model tapped into the power of community and is a clear reflection that science publication is not a solitary endeavor but rather can   is done by groups of scholars.

### Open Education

### Institutions

Academia second most conservative instution every invented, next to opera

Academic reward system

Ironically, it would appear that open source and academic science have been
largely separated at birth. Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel
and arguably one of the major figures in the open source movement, expressed
his disenchantment with the state of operating systems research in academia as
a motivation for leaving the university [@Moody:2001vg].



### Commercialization of Science


### Scientific Publishing

Concerns about scientific software [@Joppa17052013; @Yalta:2010xq].


austerity debacle


## Peer Review


## Open Data
In order for the network effects of open science to kick in a necessary condition will be that data underlying research projects be made accessibile to the wider research community. Unfortunately, current institutional constraints and individual practices are standing in the way of realizing this.

### Privacy Concerns

There are important concerns regarding the protection of personal information on the one hand, and the rich set of empirical analyses that micro data support on the other. A number of strategies have been explored to strike this balance. Anonymization of public records attempt to minize the risk of revealing information about individuals. However, this has its limit as a number of high profile failures have demonstrated.

One example being the case of the State of Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission (GIC) responsible for purchasing health insurance for state employees [@Sweeney:2005uq]. As part of that effort GIC anonymized data by removal of names, addresses, and Social Security numbers before releasing to researchers. What remained in the released data were ZIP code, birth date and gender of each person along with diagnoses and prescription information.

A researcher was able to purchase a voter registration list for Cambridge for $20 that contained the name, address, ZIP code, birth date and gender of each voter. Linking this with the GIC data made it possible to identify the medical records for the state govener, since only six people had the same birth date, of these three were men, and only one of these had the same ZIP code.

### Data Hoarding
Clearly there are problems with anonymization procedures and a very active research agenda is developing around privitatization XXXcites. An alternative to anonymization is the use of
save havens as secure sites for data containing sensitive person information with access being granted to authorized researchers. In the US, Census Research Centers play this role and offer remarkable opportunities for regional scientists to have access to micro data subject to a number of restrictions designed to ensure confidentiality. XXXrefs and details see mms proposal on numbers

Although the CRCs are  successfull protecting privacy concerns I think it important to keep in mind that they also place limits on the network effect and science's self-correcting mechaism. This is because replication of studies that come out of CRC research is difficult if not impossible as any researcher seeking to do so requires access to the same data used in the original study. That access is only granted by the CRC which faces difficult choices in determining what proposals get approved for access, and given the choice between proposals for new novel studies versus studies that seek to replicate previous studies, it is conceivable that the former may be viewed more favorably.

# Opportunities


## A Way Forward


## Open Community

notion of "open people"

importance of community

strength of regional science is its interdisciplanary outlook

## Conclusion

Way forward will represent a mixture of open and proprietary regional science. This hybrid model will, however, represent a rebalancing of many components of regional science as it engages with open science. Our choice is whether that engagement takes an active or passive form.

To close this talk I think regional scientists (actually all scientists) would do well by taking the Dalai Lama's recommendation to heart:

> Share your knowledge, it is a way to achieve immortality.
